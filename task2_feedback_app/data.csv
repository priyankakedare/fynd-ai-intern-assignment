1,"U can go there n check the car out. If u wanna buy 1 there? That's wrong move! If u even want a car service from there? U made a biggest mistake of ur life!! I had 1 time asked my girlfriend to take my car there for an oil service, guess what? They ripped my girlfriend off by lying how bad my car is now. If without fixing the problem. Might bring some serious accident. Then she did what they said. 4 brand new tires, timing belt, 4 new brake pads. U know why's the worst? All of those above I had just changed 2 months before!!! What a trashy dealer is that? People, better off go somewhere!

[Your Dealership Name]","The customer had a severely negative experience with a car dealer, claiming they were ripped off and overcharged for unnecessary repairs after their girlfriend was misled about the condition of their car.","Based on the customer review, one clear recommended action is:

**Warning and Review Removal**: The review seems to be written in a threatening and aggressive tone, which may not be helpful to others in making informed decisions. It's recommended to either remove the review or edit it to make it more constructive and helpful, such as providing a detailed account of the incident and the steps taken to resolve the issue, if any. This would be a more effective way to warn potential customers about the dealership without resorting to personal attacks or aggressive language."
